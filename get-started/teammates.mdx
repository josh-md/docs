## Accepting an Invitation

When a teammate is invited, they'll receive an email from MessageDesk. This email will route them to `inbox.messagedesk.com/#/create-account`

To accept their invitation, they just need to create an account with the same email address they were invited with.

Upon account creation, they'll be automatically added to any inboxes they've been invited to.

## Teammate Roles & Permissions

### Default Roles:

By default, each inbox comes with 3 roles:

1. \*\*Admin: \*\*full access to the inbox, all phone numbers and all conversations. Full account level access for billing, teammates and phone number management. They can create, edit and delete anything in MessageDesk.
2. **Manager**: Full access to the inbox, all phone numbers and all conversations. Full access to team management (invite and remove teammates) and phone management (add/remove phone numbers). **\_Read-only access to account information like billing & workspace details. \_**
3. \*\*Operator: \*\*Full access to the inbox, all phone numbers and all conversations. View only access to workspace information, team management and phone management.

You can also create custom roles with custom permissions. This is how you can customize which teammates have access to which conversations or features within the Inbox.
